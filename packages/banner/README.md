Banners in Freshdesk
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Banners display information at the top of the screen and alert the user about effects on further usage of the product due to a particular activity, functionality or product-wide status information.

Scenario
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Banners persist until the related issue ends (not dismissable unlike notifications). Due to their location on the top, the rest of the UI is pushed below relatively during their appearance.

ember install @freshworks/tabs
```

Tabs are used to organise content under each section.

Scenario
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tabs are most helpful when there is a lot of content to show in a page. Tabs can help in showing content which are under the same level of hierarchy, under each section inside the same page.

Guidelines
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Do's**
1. Tabs should be placed in a single row over the content
2. Include all interactive states for the tabs


**Dont's**
1. Dont use tabs for sequential content. Users can navigate to any tab at any time and cannot be expected to do it sequentially.
